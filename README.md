# Deep Learning With DeepLens and SageMaker

AI, Machine Learning and IoT projects are becoming ever more important for enterprises and startups alike. These advanced technologies have been the key innovation engine for businesses such as Amazon Go, Alexa, Amazon Robotics. In this one-day workshop, we will cover the scenarios of AI and IoT working together.

- Building and training deep learning models in the cloud using Amazon SageMaker.  
- Deploying AI models to devices like the AWS DeepLens.

We will provide a hands-on learning experience by build an end-to-end systems for face detection, recognition and verification. The workshop is designed for developers that are curious about these new technologies with no ML background assumed.   

Basic requirement: Hands-on experience with python, and basic understanding of AWS services such as S3 and Lambda.
